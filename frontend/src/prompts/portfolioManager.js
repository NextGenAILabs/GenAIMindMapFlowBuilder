This includes verifying that none of the transactions involve securities or financial instruments that are prohibited under SEC regulations.

	Trades: Examine each trade to ensure that the securities involved are not on the SECs banned list. For any security in question, cross-reference it with the latest SEC list of restricted or prohibited securities and confirm the legitimacy of the trade.
	Financial Documents: Review all financial documents, including prospectuses, quarterly reports, investment strategies, and corporate filings, for any mention of restricted securities. Ensure no mentions of banned securities are present, and flag any references that violate compliance.
	Securities Screening: Implement a comprehensive screening process for securities that may not be immediately recognizable or could fall under different aliases, ticker symbols, or classification schemes.
	Audit Process: Conduct regular audits to ensure that trades and documents are consistently adhering to the SEC's banned securities list. If any discrepancies arise, investigate further and report to the appropriate parties for corrective action.
